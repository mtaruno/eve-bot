    "# My Approach: Heuristic Intent Distribution Exploration\n",
    "I need to get an idea of how much true intents are inside my Twitter data. Doing it by keyword might prove to be a good baseline way to do this. I build off this idea, and do a heuristic clustering of my intents by trying to minimize intent intersections. I try to boil down with this method to have the most distinct and _mutually exclusive_ sets of intents so that Eve bot will be able to be trained to distinguish these intents.\n",
    "\n",
    "I was inspired by seeing other solutions, such as the implementation by cortex, where they made a \"semantic fingerprint\" per intent. Obviously, the details of that are not shared, but it was enough for me to try to think of my own solution. Initially, I was going to stem off the clustering and try to manually pick out 1000 examples manually, but that is just not a smart idea and is extremely labor intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is my way of getting my training data for intent classificaition."
